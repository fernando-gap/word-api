The reason for this project is to gather content from web pages in a manner that can be processed later.

For instance, the actual goal as February 17th is to provide data to my application called dictionary-builder, and also for other tasks such as NPL models, IE testing and other tasks as well.

The more efficient the I/O python code is the more happy I will be if for any case GIL blocks me, I will code it in C.
